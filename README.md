# discord screenshot bot  
a simple discord bot with a /screenshot command to remotely see what's on your screen anywhere you go!!  
make sure to run `npm install` and rename `.env.example` to `.env` before starting the bot

### NOTICE
this bot WILL leave EVERY server its in on startup EXCEPT for the server specified in `.env`. if you do not want this to happen, use a different bot account instead.
(i'll add an option to disable it eventually)
